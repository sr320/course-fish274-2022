#### 1 - Revising your Projects

Revise your Week 4 and Week 5 projects such that they adhere to the principles outlined in the this weekâ€™s reading.

Pay particular attention to the ability of your work to be Reproducible. That is, I should be able to run your code such that no errors occur.

Correct any errors made previously (see my comments). All  graphs should match solutions.

Pay particular attention to file / directory structure and general organization.

Upload a single project with both assignments.

This will overwrite your prior grades, presuming you do better.
