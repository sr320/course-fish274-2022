**Mini Project question**

Create an Rmd file that reads in your data and use dyplr start to manipulate the data and ggplot to create at least one plot.

Your Rmd file should nicely format your prose, code and plots.â€¨ Be sure to include prose that briefly describes your process.

Using knitr export the file to HTML and save in `output` directory.

Remember to push all of your commits to the repo on GitHub as this is what I will be looking at.
